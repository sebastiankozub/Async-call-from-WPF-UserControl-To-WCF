# Async-call-from-WPF-UserControl-To-WCF

Simple and broken ;) pattern for WPF-to-WCF asynchronous communication and few more intersting features. 
PriceHumanizer project which is responsible for translating numeric price representation into lexical one. 
Interesing functionalities:
   - non-blocking calls to WCF
   - non-blocking calls to SpeechSynthesizer
   - auto-updatable rows in UserControl - once initialized updates themself with WCF without use of MainWindows logic
   
Wrong bindings
